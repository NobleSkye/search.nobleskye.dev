                <strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 3, 2025<br>
                <strong>Short Version:</strong> We don't track you, we don't store your data, and we don't know who you are.
            </div>

            <h2>Our Privacy Commitment</h2>
            <p>Skye Search is built with privacy as our core principle. We believe you should be able to search the web without being tracked, profiled, or having your personal information collected.</p>

            <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Search Queries:</strong> We do not log, store, or track your search terms</li>
                <li><strong>IP Addresses:</strong> We do not store IP addresses or location data</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect names, email addresses, or any personal identifiers</li>
                <li><strong>Browsing History:</strong> We do not track what sites you visit or your browsing patterns</li>
                <li><strong>User Profiles:</strong> We do not create profiles or fingerprints of users</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies for Tracking:</strong> We do not use cookies to track users across sessions</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technical Information</h2>
            <p>Skye Search is powered by SearXNG, an open-source metasearch engine that is specifically designed to protect user privacy:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Logging:</strong> SearXNG does not log search queries</li>
                <li><strong>Anonymous Requests:</strong> All search requests to other engines are made anonymously</li>
                <li><strong>No Cookies Required:</strong> The core search functionality works without any cookies</li>
                <li><strong>No JavaScript Required:</strong> Basic search works even with JavaScript disabled</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data We May Temporarily Process</h2>
            <p>To provide search results, we temporarily process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Search Terms:</strong> Only for the duration needed to fetch and return results</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Requests:</strong> Standard web server requests that are not logged or stored</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Important:</strong> This data is processed in memory only and is never written to disk or stored in any persistent form.
            </div>

            <h2>Local Storage</h2>
            <p>The Skye Search interface may use local browser storage for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Custom Shortcuts:</strong> Your personal website shortcuts (stored locally on your device)</li>
                <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Your personalization settings (stored locally on your device)</li>
                <li><strong>AI Privacy Acknowledgments:</strong> Whether you've acknowledged third-party AI service warnings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data never leaves your device and can be cleared at any time through your browser settings.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <h3>Search Engines</h3>
            <p>Skye Search aggregates results from various search engines. When you search, your query is sent anonymously to these services. We act as a proxy to protect your privacy, but these services have their own privacy policies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google</li>
                <li>Bing</li>
                <li>DuckDuckGo</li>
                <li>Other search engines as configured</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>AI Chat Services</h3>
            <p>When you use the AI chat feature, you connect directly to third-party AI services. We always warn you before connecting and require explicit acknowledgment. These services include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ChatGPT (OpenAI)</li>
                <li>Claude (Anthropic)</li>
                <li>Gemini (Google)</li>
                <li>Other AI services you may add</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Important:</strong> These AI services have their own privacy policies and data collection practices. We are not responsible for their data handling. Always review their privacy policies before use.
            </div>

            <h2>Favicon Requests</h2>
            <p>For custom shortcuts, we may request favicons (website icons) from Google's favicon service. These requests include the domain name but no personal information or search data.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to our systems:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Minimal Attack Surface:</strong> We minimize data collection to reduce security risks</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> We keep our software up to date with security patches</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not use any analytics services, tracking pixels, or third-party monitoring tools.</strong> We don't use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google Analytics</li>
                <li>Facebook Pixel</li>
                <li>Any advertising networks</li>
                <li>Any tracking or monitoring services</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect any personal information, our service is safe for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13, and our privacy-first approach protects all users regardless of age.</p>

            <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Since we don't collect contact information, we cannot notify users directly of changes.</p>
